# pystats

The project is inspired by the idea from the article
[Python as a Way of Thinking](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2017/04/python-as-way-of-thinking.html) by Allen Downey:
thinking math through Python, thinking Python to solve problems.

## Introduction

The project is a collection of jupyter on various statistics topics.
Most problems are from a Khan Academy's course on [statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability).

The theory behind the calculations is not explained in the notebooks, however I'm trying to add summary and underlying formulas for the solutions in Python.
