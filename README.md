# pystats

The project is inspired by the idea from the article
[Python as a Way of Thinking](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2017/04/python-as-way-of-thinking.html) by Allen Downey:
thinking math through Python, thinking Python to solve problems.

## Structure

The project is a collection of jupyter notebooks containing:

1. Notes on statistics and probability
2. Problems from Khan Academy's course on [statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) 
and sample solutions in Python for some of the problems

## Contents

1. Analyzing categorical data
2. Displaying and comparing quantitative data
3. Summarizing quantitative data
4. Modeling data distributions
5. Exploring bivariate numerical data
6. Study design
7. Probability
8. Counting, permutations, and combinations
9. [Random variables](random_variables.ipynb):
10. [Sampling distributions](sampling_distributions.ipynb)
11. Confidence intervals
12. Significance tests (hypothesis testing)
13. Two-sample inference for the difference between groups
14. Inference for categorical data (chi-square tests)
15. Advanced regression (inference and transforming)
16. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
