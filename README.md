# pystats

The project is inspired by the idea from the article
[Python as a Way of Thinking](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2017/04/python-as-way-of-thinking.html) by Allen Downey:
thinking math through Python, thinking Python to solve problems.

## Structure

The project is a collection of jupyter notebooks containing:

1. Notes on statistics and probability
2. Problems from Khan Academy's course on [statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) 
and sample solutions in Python for some of the problems
